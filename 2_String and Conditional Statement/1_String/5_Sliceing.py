# Slicing means Assecing part form the string with the help of indexing.

# In sliceing Starting path is defined and ending path is not defind

#For Example: 

str = "Shekhar"
# here i want to print form h to h, so the condition is 1:4
print(str[1:5])

# For example you want to go the last of the string 

str_1 = "Shekhar Suman" # Here i don't want to print Shekhar .

print(str_1[8:len(str_1)])

# If you show this type of syntax of code then don't be worry 

print(str_1[:10]) # it means start for 0th index
print(str_1[3:]) # it means strt with 3 but end at the "len(str_1)". in eassiest way End at the last word of the sentences.
